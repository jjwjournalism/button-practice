      <p class="catProfile">Luna is a small black cat. She's blind in one eye, but she doesn't let her lack of depth perception stop her from knocking delicate objects off my desk. Her hobbies include chasing string toys and shedding on white carpet. </p>

      <p class="catProfile">Lucy is a large, fluffy black and white cat. She's polydactyl, meaning that she has a couple of extra toes on each foot. Thus, her feet are referred to as "kitten mittens." Lucy has two main loves in life: human food, and brutally murdering her
        favorite toy mouse, again and again and again.</p>
